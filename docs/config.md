#### Custom variables
You can define custom variables to use them inside project templates. Custom template variables have priority over local variables.

### Distribute config
You can set the environment variable `BUTLER_CONFIG_URL` to any url to load your config from an external storage. This make it easy to distribute template updates across a company. You local configuration is merged.
